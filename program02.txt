1. Find all the customers who have atleast two accounts at the Main branch. 
select distinct(customer_name), count(*) 
from account a, depositor d 
where a.accno=d.accno 
and d.accno in (select accno from account 
where branch_name=’jaynagar’) 
group by d.customer_name 
having count(*)>=2;

2. Find all the customers who have an account at all the branches located in a specific city. 
select d.customer_name 
from account a, depositor d, branch b 
where b.branch_name=a.branch_name and a.accno=d.accno 
and b.branch_city=’bangalore’ 
having count(distinct b.branch_name)=(select count(branch_name) 
from branch 
where branch_city=’bangalore’) 
group by customer_name; 

3. Demonstrate how you delete all account tuples at every branch located in a specific city. 
delete from account 
where branch_name in (select branch_name 
from branch 
where branch_city='delhi');
